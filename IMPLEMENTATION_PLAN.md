# Blossomss Co-Parenting App Implementation Plan

Based on analysis of PLAN.md and PRD.md, here's a comprehensive implementation roadmap for transforming Blossomss from a responsive landing page into a fully functional co-parenting platform.

## Current Status Assessment

**Completed Foundation Work:**
- Responsive design enhancements (hero section, speech bubbles)
- Core UI components and animations
- Database schema defined (now migrated to Firestore)
- Basic project structure and technology stack
- **COMPLETE: Firebase/Firestore Migration (January 2025)**
  - All 28 data models migrated from PostgreSQL to Firestore
  - Firebase Authentication fully integrated
  - FirestoreService created as centralized data access layer
  - TypeScript types updated throughout codebase
  - All compilation errors resolved

**✅ LATEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS (July 2025):**
- ✅ All 26 Firebase migration tests passing
- ✅ Comprehensive security rules deployed to production
- ✅ Production build completed successfully
- ✅ Real-time listener hooks implemented
- ✅ Offline functionality guide created

  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User can only read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Family members can access shared data
    match /children/{childId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.parentIds;
    }
    
    // Messages between family members
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.senderId 
                  || request.auth.uid == resource.data.receiverId;
    }
  }
}
```

*Role-Based Access Control:*

- User engagement increase >30%

## Next Sprint Planning

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. Run migration test script
