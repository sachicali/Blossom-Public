## [1.4.6] - 2025-06-30

### Features
- **True Horizontal Speech Bubble Layout**: Complete transformation from vertical to horizontal emphasis
  - **Forced Single-Line Layout**: Removed `flex-wrap` and implemented `flex items-center justify-between`
  - **Fixed Height Containers**: Set explicit height constraints (h-12 parent, h-16 child) with `overflow-hidden`
  - **Text Truncation**: Added `truncate` and `white-space: nowrap` to prevent vertical wrapping
  - **No-Wrap Design**: Content now flows in true horizontal banner style

### Problem Solved
- **Eliminated Vertical Stacking**: Previous horizontal flow still allowed content to wrap vertically
- **Fixed Tall Bubble Issue**: Speech bubbles were growing vertically instead of staying horizontally wide
- **Forced Banner Layout**: Created true letterbox/banner appearance with consistent low height
- **Single-Line Content**: Text and elements now flow horizontally without vertical overflow

### Technical Implementation
**Layout Architecture Changes:**
- **Parent Bubbles**: `flex flex-wrap` → `flex items-center justify-between` with `h-12 overflow-hidden`
- **Child Bubble**: `flex flex-wrap` → `flex items-center justify-between` with `h-16 overflow-hidden`
- **Content Flow**: `gap-x-3 gap-y-1` → `gap-x-3` (removed vertical gaps)
- **Text Handling**: Added `truncate` class and `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'` for single-line text

**Benefits:**
- **True Horizontal Emphasis**: Speech bubbles now appear as wide, low banners
- **Consistent Height**: Fixed heights prevent vertical growth regardless of content
- **Modern Banner Design**: Letterbox appearance creates contemporary, streamlined look
- **Responsive Horizontal Flow**: Content adapts horizontally while maintaining low profile

**Key Changes:**
- Removed all `flex-wrap` instances that allowed vertical stacking
- Added explicit height constraints with overflow hidden
- Implemented text truncation for single-line content display
- Changed layout from `justify-center` to `justify-between` for horizontal distribution

**Modified Files:**
- `client/src/components/landing/parent-speech-bubbles.tsx`: Horizontal layout transformation
- `client/src/components/landing/child-speech-bubble.tsx`: Consistent horizontal flow implementation
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Documentation of horizontal layout fixes

## [1.4.5] - 2025-06-30

### Features
- **Parent Bubble Wide & Low Profile**: Streamlined parent speech bubbles for better horizontal emphasis
  - **Increased Width**: Expanded from 480px → 580px max-width for better horizontal real estate
  - **Reduced Height**: Multiple approaches to create lower, more streamlined profile
  - **Flatter Appearance**: Reduced border radius from 40px → 28px for modern, streamlined look

- Padding: `clamp(12px, 2.5vw, 18px)` → `clamp(8px, 1.5vw, 12px)` for lower height
- Vertical gaps: `gap-y-2` → `gap-y-1` for more compact spacing
- Border radius: `rounded-[40px]` → `rounded-[28px]` for flatter appearance

**Benefits:**
- **Modern Horizontal Flow**: Enhanced emphasis on left-to-right content arrangement
- **Improved Screen Usage**: Better utilization of horizontal screen real estate
- **Streamlined Design**: More contemporary, banner-like appearance

- **To**: `flex-wrap` horizontal flow with inline "heading | message | actions" pattern
- **Content Hugging**: Auto-resize based on actual content width, eliminating empty vertical space
- **Responsive Wrapping**: Smart horizontal text flow with natural breaks on smaller screens

**Modified Files:**
- `client/src/components/landing/child-speech-bubble.tsx`: Complete horizontal flow transformation
